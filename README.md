# Intro Summary

This GitHub repository is dedicated to showcasing a collection of awesome free and open-source alternatives to ChatGPT (List 1) and pilot training courseware (List 2). These resources offer a wide range of functionalities, providing developers and enthusiasts with accessible tools to build and enhance conversational AI models and pilot training materials. By leveraging these open alternatives, you can support the community-driven innovation that powers AI research and development.

# List 1: ChatGPT open-source alternatives 

## [lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch)

Implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of the PaLM architecture. Basically ChatGPT but with PaLM


## [togethercomputer/OpenChatKit](https://github.com/togethercomputer/OpenChatKit)

OpenChatKit provides a powerful, open-source base to create both specialized and general purpose chatbots for various applications. 

## [oobabooga/text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui)

A gradio web UI for running Large Language Models like GPT-J 6B, OPT, GALACTICA, LLaMA, and Pygmalion.

## [KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client](https://github.com/KoboldAI/KoboldAI-Client)

This is a browser-based front-end for AI-assisted writing with multiple local & remote AI models. It offers the standard array of tools, including Memory, Authorâ€™s Note, World Info, Save & Load, adjustable AI settings, formatting options, and the ability to import existing AI Dungeon adventures. 


## [LAION-AI/Open-Assistant](https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant) 

OpenAssistant is a chat-based assistant that understands tasks, can interact with third-party systems, and retrieve information dynamically to do so.


## [tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca](https://github.com/tatsu-lab/stanford_alpaca)

This is the repo for the Stanford Alpaca project, which aims to build and share an instruction-following LLaMA model.

### Other LLaMA-derived projects:

- [pointnetwork/point-alpaca](https://github.com/pointnetwork/point-alpaca) Released weights recreated from Stanford Alpaca, an experiment in fine-tuning LLaMA on a synthetic instruction dataset.
- [nomic-ai/gpt4all](https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all) Demo, data and code to train an assistant-style large language model with ~800k GPT-3.5-Turbo Generations based on LLaMA.

## [BlinkDL/ChatRWKV](https://github.com/BlinkDL/ChatRWKV)

ChatRWKV is like ChatGPT but powered by RWKV (100% RNN) language model, and open source.


## [THUDM/ChatGLM-6B](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM-6B)

ChatGLM-6B is an open bilingual language model based on General Language Model (GLM) framework, with 6.2 billion parameters.

## [carperai/trlx](https://github.com/carperai/trlx)

 A repo for distributed training of language models with Reinforcement Learning via Human Feedback (RLHF), supporting online RL up to 20b params and offline RL to larger models. Basically what you would use to finetune GPT into ChatGPT. 

## [databrickslabs/dolly](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly)

Script to fine tune [GPT-J 6B](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) model on the [Alpaca](https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca) dataset. Insightful if you want to fine tune LLMs.

## [ethanyanjiali/minChatGPT](https://github.com/ethanyanjiali/minChatGPT)

A minimum example of aligning language models with RLHF similar to ChatGPT
